# Project Description

This project involves developing a Python-based software solution for a small family business that sells games. The software aims to streamline the management of customer orders, inventory, and sales records while ensuring data security and accuracy. A simple text-based interface will be used to interact with the system, allowing for efficient operation without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

The solution will include features to accept customer orders, check game availability, manage stock levels, and generate reports on sales activity, such as a full list of orders in the last month.
